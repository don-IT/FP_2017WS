Content of the course

The lecture leads in theory and practice in the principles and
Concepts of functional programming style and spans the
Bow from the basics to the application. In the
Lecture-accompanying plenary session Haskell Live will take the example
practical tasks presented and discussed, such as
These can be used for solution. In particular, also
own solution proposals presented and put up for discussion
become. In the practice section, the functional programming style is based on
Examples independently applied and practiced and so in-depth
theoretical and practical understanding of the concepts and
Principles of functional programming developed and acquired. As
Demonstration and implementation language will be presented in lecture and
Practice the functional state-of-the-art programming language Haskell
used.
